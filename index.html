        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a 
            guru or preceptor after initiation.[35] The education was delivered through Gurukula. 
            The relationship between Guru and his Shishya (students /disciples) was very important
             part of the education.[36] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of 
             ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is 
             debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers
              living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not 
              seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in 
              contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system
               of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the 
               Pali language.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education 
            system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. 
            Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
             Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children 
             aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India 
             is 10:3.[7]
            Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, 
            primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies 
            significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, 
            religion, language, and disability.
